# Shelly
 Shelly mJS used at home

 I did the Open University M255 Java course back in 2010, so I'm a bit rusty on that front but I now have a number
 of Shelly microcontrollers and find the need for JavaScript.
 
 This Git is more to help my understanding as I work through the Shelly Script Language Features* to get a  better
 understanding of how they function. Hopefully it will be helpful for others.
